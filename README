Project 4: Arith 
By: Kalyn Muhlenberg (kmuhle01) and Hannah Shader (hshade01)

Identifies you and your programming partner by name:
- Kalyn Muhlenberg and Hannah Shader
Briefly explains your architecture (i.e. which files do what):
- Bitpack.h/Bitpack.c
    - files that hold functions for inspecting/modifying
    bit sequences as int64_ts and uint64_ts

- file_word.h/file_word.c
    - files that hold functions for reading files to
    an 2D array of uint32_ts, and for writing arrays
    of uint32_ts to files

- word_unpacked.h/word_unpacked.c
    - files that hold functions for bitunpacking
    arrays of type uint32_ts to structs that hold their 
    data more plainly, and for writing arrays
    of structs that hold unpacked data more plainly to
    arrays of uint32_ts

- unpacked_cv.h/unpacked_cv.c
    - files that hold functions for bitunpacking
    arrays of type uint32_ts to structs that hold their 
    data more plainly, and for writing arrays
    of structs that hold unpacked data more plainly to
    arrays of uint32_ts

- cv_rgb.h/cv_rgb.c
    - files that hold functions for converting a 2D array of
    representative structs of color video pixels to Pnm-ppm
    red, green, blue pixels, and visa versa

- compress40.h/compress40.c
    - hold functions that call other files to fully convert from
    a Pnm_ppm to a output file in the specified format, and 
    from an output file in the specified format to a pnm_ppm
    - frees all data associated with the temporary arrays
    created for the compression and decompression

Acknowledges help you may have received from or collaborative 
work you may have undertaken with others:
    - Only recieved help from the TAs
Identifies what has been correctly implemented and what has not:
    - We believe that everything has been correctly implemented
Says approximately how many hours you have spent analyzing the 
problems posed in the assignment:
    - We believe we have spent approximately 5 hours 
Says approximately how many hours you have spent solving the 
problems after your analysis:
    - We believe we have spent approximately 25 hours
